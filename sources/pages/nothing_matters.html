                    Sometimes, do you ever feel fine, like completely fine,
                    going through your day and doing your task, and suddenly,
                    a strange feeling begin to creep in and whisphers echoes of
                    questions like, "Wait. Why am I doing this?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a 3rd year college student majoring in
                    Information Technology. My usual weekly routine looks like
                    this: On Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays,
                    I dive into the world of IT, attending my classes
                    These days are filled with lectures, discussions,
                    and the camaraderie of fellow students
                    navigating the same technological landscape.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yet, amidst the computer codes and syntax,
                    there are moments when a peculiar thought sneaks
                    in: 'Does any
                    of this truly matter?' In the grand scheme of the universe,
                    do these algorithms and assignments hold
                    any weight?''
                </p>

                <p>
                    In moments like
                    those, the routine we've meticulously crafted
                    becomes a theater for existential inquiry.
                    The mundanity of daily life collides with the profound,
                    and we find ourselves standing at the
                    crossroads of purpose and uncertainty. It's like
                    someone lifted a curtain, showing us the
                    complicated dance of our actions against the big
                    backdrop of the universe.
                </p>
                <p><b>Is there meaning in these tasks,
                        or are they just parts of a
                        bigger puzzle we don't get yet?</b></p>
                <p>----------</p>
                <p>
                    When I look at the night sky, I see the dance of stars
                    trying to fight the darkness of the universe.
                    Think about this: the speed of light travels at around
                    300,000 kilometers per second. So, for example, if
                    the Sun were to disappear right now, it would take
                    8 minutes before we actually notice it as its
                    light finally fades for one last time.

                    But for the stars millions of light years far away from
                    us, it would take thousands to millions of years before
                    it even reach us. This also means that the light
                    from the stars we see
                    right now, some of them may have long vanished in the
                    distant past, and that information just hadn't had reached
                    our world yet.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Why does light travels the way it does? Why does it have
                    a limit? What dictated the laws of light, or
                    everything? Like a computer programmer who carefully
                    writes a code for their program to run, did anyone
                    write the rules and laws of the universe?
                </p>
                <p>----------</p>
                <p>
                    Think of a ball that is thrown upwards. Using physics,
                    we can tell the trajectory of an object if we know all
                    the configurations of the object, and the external factors
                    in the environment, we can precisely tell where it will
                    land exactly. In short, the laws of the universe
                    allow for the exact prediction of the physical objects,
                    we aren't just advanced enough to know all the
                    information to make it possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, consider your current actions. How certain are you
                    that every move you make stems from a
                    genuine desire? We, as humans, often take for
                    granted that free will is as innate as the act of
                    breathing itself.

                    But when you dig into it, making choices isn't as
                    straightforward as it seems. Are we in control of
                    what we decide, or are we just following a script
                    influenced by a bunch of things around us?

                    The idea of free will can be kind of tricky.
                    We live thinking our decisions are our own, but when
                    you look closer, you see all these
                    different factors playing a role.

                    As I'm thinking about this, I realize there's a
                    back-and-forth between us having control over our
                    choices and things kind of being predetermined.
                    Even the act of questioning free will shows this
                    paradox â€“ wondering about choice while not
                    being sure where those questions are coming from.

                    In a world where everything works in a cause-and-effect
                    way, with our brains doing stuff we aren't
                    even aware of, the whole free will thing gets a bit shaky.
                    It's a deep question that people have
                    been trying to figure out for a really long time.

                </p>
                <p>----------</p>
                <p>
                    Why do we have laws, and who were the architects of
                    justice? What compels us to determine what is
                    right and wrong? If I peel back the layers of societal
                    norms and ethical principles, will I uncover
                    a universal truth, or is morality just a collective illusion
                    we've woven to bring order to our
                    chaos?

                    Contemplating the origin of governments led me down a rabbit
                    hole of political philosophy. Who first
                    conceived the idea of governance, and why did societies
                    choose to organize themselves in such
                    intricate structures? Is the pursuit of power an intrinsic
                    part of human nature, or did it emerge as
                    a response to the complexities of communal living?

                    As I ponder the blue shirt draped over my shoulders, I
                    wonder about the origin of fashion itself.
                    Who decided that certain colors and styles are aesthetically
                    pleasing? Did someone, at some point,
                    envision a world adorned in fabrics, or did fashion arise
                    organically from the kaleidoscope of human
                    creativity?

                    If I rewind the time, how far will I be able to go?
                    What is the beginning of everything?
                    How did life arise? How did humans exist? Science
                    and religion have both tried to answer these questions,
                    but one thing remained: the elusive mystery shrouding the
                    beginning of it all.
                </p>
                <p>----------</p>
                <p>
                    As I write these bunch of random questions in my
                    computer screen, eight billion other individuals are
                    also too busy with their own lives, each with their
                    own life, beliefs, world, ideas, fear, hopes, and dreams.

                    Some people are really happy on one side of the world,
                    having a good time. But on the other side,
                    some are struggling just to get some food.
                    It's like a big difference between having a lot and
                    having almost nothing.

                    While I'm sitting here comfortably,
                    somewhere a mom might be feeling really sad because
                    she lost her
                    son. In another place, a child might have been hurt or
                    killed because of wars between countries.

                    In quiet places at home, a woman might be very sad because
                    she lost her sister. At the same time,
                    someone who didn't do anything wrong might be in
                    trouble, going to jail for their whole life.

                    When the new year starts, some families are happy
                    and have plenty of things. But on the other side,
                    there are families with nothing on their table,
                    starting the new year in a tough way.

                    Governments will fight wars, and leaders will shake their
                    hands. But the mother of a soldier who fell in the
                    battlefield will wait for his son, only for him
                    to never come back.

                    The human life is an intricate tapestry of
                    experiences, emotions, and connections, woven together in
                    a complexity that surpasses our understanding.
                    It unfolds on our tiny little blue planet, a mere speck of
                    dot in the vastness of space, adding another layer to
                    the astonishing complexity of our existence.
                </p>
                <p>----------</p>
                <p>
                    Let's talk about the future.

                    In a few decades, you and I will vanish off the face of the
                    Earth, and so does all our hopes,
                    dreams, fears, and conciousness. People would tell you,
                    "that's okay, it's about the impact you made
                    to people around you" and while that may seem comforting at
                    first, the truth is that eventually all
                    the people you supposedly "impacted" will be gone as well.

                    In a few million years, when humanity is lucky enough not to
                    blow itself up to extinction, the Sun
                    will have swallowed our blue planet and destroy it. You may
                    say, "well probably at that point we may
                    have colonized other planets". But all those planets will
                    face the same fate, eventually as well. In
                    the far future, the universe will have become so vast that
                    all the galaxies will have shifted away
                    from us, and all future humans will see is nothing but
                    infinite darkness, thinking theirs are the
                    only place existing in the universe.

                    In a far future after that, all the stars in the universe
                    will run out of their gas, dimming one by
                    one. All that's left are black holes. But even black holes
                    will evaporate too in an amount of time
                    so long, we may as well equate it to infinity.

                    And then that's it. We may have reached the end of time.
                    All the beauty and ugliness of what once
                    called "Earth", all our philosophy, all our art, all our
                    science, all our joy, hope, pride, terror,
                    all the governments, all the clothes we loved to wear,
                    all the songs we loved to sing, all the
                    places we used to love will be gone - as if they never
                    existed. The universe has completely reached
                    the state of maximum entropy.

                    If everything is heading towards death and decay, then
                    what is the point of everything? What is the
                    point of doing what I do? If all of these will be gone
                    and there's nobody to remember it, then does
                    anything really matter?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Probably not. Maybe none of these matters.
                    The universe,
                    in all its vastness, indeed seems indifferent to our
                    existence. It lacks an inherent purpose, and perhaps,
                    in the grand scheme of things, whatever I do
                    holds little significance.

                    But recently, I'm starting to come to terms with these
                    cold brute facts.
                    Maybe that's okay. Nothing matters. I get to create
                    my own meaning, my own purpose.

                    In a world where the universe remains silent
                    on the significance of my actions, I get to choose what
                    matters to me, forge my own path, and define the
                    purpose that resonates with the depths of my being.
