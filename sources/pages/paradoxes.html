                    Ever felt like your brain does a flip when you hear
                    something that just doesn't add up? That's the
                    magic of paradoxes – those mind-bending riddles that
                    make you go, "Wait, what?" Paradoxes are like
                    brain teasers on steroids,
                    always keeping us on our mental toes.

                    Picture this: you think you've got something figured out,
                    and then bam! It's the opposite. It's like
                    trying to catch a slippery fish – the more you think
                    you've got it, the more it slips away.
                </p>
                <p>

                    I love paradoxes. I've always been drawn to them
                    because they
                    mess with the rules of the thinking game. They're
                    the ultimate rebels of logic, flipping our ideas upside down
                    and inside out. Join me on this wild ride
                    through paradoxes, where the only rule is there are
                    no rules, and confusion is just the beginning.
                    Get ready for a mental adventure that'll make you
                    question everything you thought you knew.

                    First things first, let us properly define what a
                    paradox is just so we're on the same boat. Dictionary.com
                    defines paradox as
                    <q>a statement that seems self-contradictory or absurd
                        but in reality expresses a possible truth</q>.

                    To put it plainly, a paradox is an apparent contradiction
                    that, upon closer inspection, reveals a
                    deeper and often unexpected layer of truth.

                    <h3>If the left one claims to be true, then it must
                        be telling the truth. But if it's telling the truth,
                        then the sentence on the left is true.
                        It creates a loop – a kind of verbal maze with
                        no clear beginning or end. This is a simple example
                        of a paradox, where the statement leads
                        to a self-referential contradiction.

                    Paradoxes have been boggling people's brains for
                    ages, making people scratch their heads from
                    ancient times to today. Thinkers, like
                    ancient philosophers and even today's scientists,
                    have been caught in the paradox web.
                    But today, we are not going to talk about simple
                    linguistic paradoxes:
                    let's examine some of the most perplexing paradoxes
                    in the realm of physics and philosophy— my two absolute
                    favorite subjects.

                <h4>Theseus Paradox</h4>
                <h6>What it challenges: the nature of identity and
                    persistence over time</h6>

                <p>
                    The Ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus'
                    Paradox, is a captivating thought experiment
                    that has boggled philosophers for centuries.
                    The paradox is named after the mythical Greek hero
                    Theseus, who, according to legend, sailed on a ship
                    that was preserved by the Athenians for centuries.
                    The thought experiment goes like this:

                    Imagine there is a ship, let's call it the Ship of Theseus.
                    Over the years, as the ship sails the
                    seas, its wooden parts start to wear out and decay.
                    To maintain the ship, the Athenians decide to
                    replace the old, decaying planks with new ones.
                    Over time, they replace every single part of the
                    ship until none of the original wooden pieces remain.
                </p>
                <div class="journal-image" id="ship">
                    <img src="https://themindcollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Ship-of-Theseus_830.jpg">
                    <h3>The Ship of Theseus was
                        rebuilt over the centuries as
                        wood rotted and broke, so at
                        what point did it stop being
                        the original, and when did it
                        become something else?
                    </h3>
                </div>
                <p>

                    Now, here comes the paradox: Is the reconstructed ship
                    still the Ship of Theseus? On one hand, every
                    part of the ship has been replaced, so technically,
                    none of the original components are present. On
                    the other hand, the ship as a whole still maintains
                    its function and purpose as the Ship of Theseus.

                    To add another layer to the puzzle, imagine that the
                    removed wooden parts from the Ship of Theseus
                    are collected and stored. The Athenians decide to use
                    these old parts to construct a new ship, which
                    is now sailing alongside the first one.

                    Now, we have two ships: one that has had all its parts
                    replaced (the Ship of Theseus), and another
                    constructed from its original parts. Which, if any, is the
                    true Ship of Theseus?

                    This paradox raises profound questions about the nature of
                    identity, continuity, and the concept of
                    what makes an object or being the same over time. It also
                    delves into philosophical discussions
                    about personal identity, as similar questions can be asked a
                    bout the persistence of identity in
                    human beings undergoing gradual changes.

                <h4>Sorites Paradox</h4>
                <h6>What it challenges: the classical understanding of how
                    categories and definitions work</h6>
                <p>
                    Now let's move on to a somewhat related paradox to the
                    Ship of Theseus. "Sorites" comes from the Greek word for
                    "heap," and the paradox explores the problem of how
                    we define categories with imprecise boundaries. The
                    paradox goes like this:
                    Imagine you have a heap of sand. Let's say it's a thousand
                    grains of sand. Now, if you remove one
                    grain, you still have a heap. No one would argue that one
                    grain of sand makes the difference between
                    a heap and a non-heap.
                    If removing one grain doesn't change a heap into a
                    non-heap, then the same logic should apply to
                    removing another grain. So, you remove one more.
                    The heap remains.
                    You continue this process, removing one grain at a time.
                    At each step, the heap still seems to be a
                    heap. However, at some point, you look at what's left,
                    and it's no longer a heap.

                    The paradox arises when you try to identify the precise
                    moment when the heap becomes a non-heap.
                    There's no clear boundary— no specific number of grains
                    where the transition occurs. It seems that
                    no matter how many grains you remove, you can't pinpoint
                    the exact moment when the heap ceases to be
                    a heap.

                    <h3>How can we define a clear boundary between a "heap" 
                        and a "non-heap" when, despite making small,
                        gradual changes like removing one grain at a time,
                        the Sorites Paradox reveals the inherent
                        vagueness in our attempts to precisely categorize 
                        such concepts?
                    </h3>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The Sorites Paradox challenges our intuition about
                    categories and definitions. It suggests that
                    certain concepts, like "heap" or "bald" or "tall," are
                    inherently vague because there's no clear
                    line of demarcation. The paradox invites us to reflect on
                    the nature of language, classification,
                    and the way we understand gradations and boundaries in our
                    everyday concepts.
