                <p>
                    Four years ago, I had to make a really important choice
                    that would decide how my life would turn
                    out. It felt like I was at a crossroads, with different
                    paths I could take. One path was familiar and safe,
                    like sticking to what I already knew. The other
                    path was more exciting and unknown,
                    offering new adventures but also more challenges.
                    As I stood there, it felt like it was more than just
                    a choice, it was a defining moment that would carve out
                    the chapters of my life story. Little did I
                    know how this decision would set the stage for the
                    journey that unfolded in the years to come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was a kid, I've been a dreamer. I had so
                    many things I wanted to be. I can still
                    remember one of my earliest dreams: to be a pilot.
                    I loved watching planes soar across the sky, and
                    the idea of being the one behind the controls fascinated me.
                    Then there was a time when I wanted to be a scientist.
                    During my grade school days, my teachers
                    always praised me for actively participating in our
                    science class. I was fascinated by learning how
                    the human body works, understanding what goes on inside
                    a cell, discovering how mountains are
                    formed, and unraveling the mysteries of how planets behave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In middle school, another dream sparked in me: to become
                    a teacher. I found joy in standing in
                    front of the class, passionately explaining lessons to
                    my classmates. I'd spend hours and days carefully curating
                    my presentation materials, aiming for mine to
                    stand out among the rest. The idea of sharing knowledge
                    and helping others understand complex topics
                    resonated with me. It was more than just presenting
                    information; it was about making learning
                    engaging and memorable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But amidst these dreams, another curiosity ignited within
                    me – a fascination with technology. Since
                    childhood, I enjoyed tinkering with our then-Pentium PC,
                    experimenting with anything I could get my
                    hands on. I'd spend hours delving into the system,
                    tweaking settings, even if I didn't fully grasp
                    what some of them meant. As smartphones became prevalent,
                    my fascination only grew. I would spend
                    countless hours scrutinizing everything, from the device's
                    settings to its hardware, and
                    meticulously arranging how my phone would look.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having all these dreams may sound exciting, but the reality
                    is, it can be challenging to pursue many
                    aspirations at once. As I approached Senior High School,
                    the difficulty of this reality became
                    clear. I found myself having a hard time deciding
                    whether to pursue the Humanities and Social
                    Sciences strand, dive into Science, Technology, and
                    Mathematics, or opt for the General Academic
                    Strand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, I made the decision to go for the Information
                    and Communication Technology (ICT) strand.
                    However, our school only had one major under ICT, which
                    was Medical Transcription. It was a
                    realization that came later than I expected. Despite this,
                    in 11th Grade, our adviser went above and
                    beyond. He dedicated his
                    Saturdays to teach us basic HTML and CSS, even though it
                    was beyond his usual teaching duties.
                    Reflecting on it now, I realize that what I learned about
                    HTML and CSS in those early sessions was
                    just the tip of the iceberg. Nevertheless,
                    these basics sparked a deep fascination and a strong
                    desire within me to craft visually appealing websites.
                    I found joy in enhancing the aesthetics of
                    text, playing with the colors of webpage elements, and
                    formatting them to create the exact look and
                    feel I envisioned. This hands-on experience ignited a
                    passion for web development, laying the
                    foundation for my journey into the captivating world of
                    coding and design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon, I would conclude my Senior High School journey on a
                    high note. I not only graduated at the top
                    of my class but also unexpectedly secured a spot in the
                    Top 10 of our batch. It was a unique
                    achievement as the only student from Technical-Vocational
                    strand that school year to ever make into the list.
                    Adding to the surprises, my team won the
                    "Best Researchers" title for our research project. That year
                    was 2019, and I was only 17. At the time, I felt like I'm
                    on top of my world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adding to my achievements, I received an email from PUP
                    Taguig confirming my success in the PUPCET.
                    On the day of the exam, I honestly didn't anticipate being
                    among the fortunate few chosen from
                    thousands of students across different cities. Yet, against
                    the odds, I made it. It was one of the
                    last times I felt a genuine sense of hope and optimism about
                    what the future held for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But with that triumph, a significant decision loomed ahead—
                    the very choice I hinted at in the
                    beginning of this journal. Should I pursue my passion in
                    English language and
                    education, or should I follow my curiosity and fascination
                    with technology and go for Information Technology? I would
                    spend my next few days and nights weighing between two
                    choices. I was aware that once I made a choice, there would
                    be no turning back, and the path
                    I selected would significantly shape the
                    course of my future.

                    Ultimately, I made the decision to embrace the path that
                    appeared more adventurous and
                    challenging: the world of Information Technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this decision, I envisioned myself, four years from
                    that moment — in 2023 — holding a degree in
                    Information Technology. Excitedly, I shared my vision with
                    four friends who also aced the PUPCET,
                    foreseeing us as teammates once again, the same
                    team that was hailed as "Best Researchers" back in
                    High School— this time
                    collaborating on our Capstone Project. I told myself I
                    would achieve to be consistently be part of Dean's and
                    President's Lister, and that I would graduate with Latin
                    Honors.
                    It was a pact I made with myself, ensuring that I had my
                    own back,
                    and that my friends were right there with me in
                    this shared journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the age of 17, I carried with me not just high hopes and
                    dreams but also a touch of naivety that often accompanies
                    such a young age.
                    I felt likeI knew everything. I thought I had figured it
                    all out.I've planned my life in the
                    next four years, expecting everything to unfold according
                    to my carefully crafted "plan."
                    But soon, life would show me it doesn't always work
                    that way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few weeks into college, doubts began to creep in.
                    It was the first time I encountered difficulty in grasping
                    certain concepts, particularly in computing and
                    programming. Back in High
                    School, numbers and mathematics has always been my
                    kryptonite. I was never excellent at them. This difficulty
                    was one of the reasons why I was having doubts
                    in choosing the IT course, as I mentioned earlier.
                    I observed a decline in my mental health, influenced by a
                    variety of reasons, notably personal and
                    family-related challenges that I won't delve into details
                    about. It seemed as if everything was
                    conspiring against my life. To cut a long story short,
                    I had to temporarily pause my college journey
                    to take a much-needed break.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I reassured myself that the break would be brief,
                    planning to return as soon as possible. However, life took
                    an unexpected turn when the global pandemic unfolded.
                    The challenges I faced were not only personal but now
                    intertwined with the
                    collective struggles of the world.
                    As the pandemic swept across the globe,
                    it disrupted plans and shifted priorities. The uncertainty
                    of the times made it difficult to predict when and how
                    normalcy would return. Amid these
                    unprecedented circumstances, my goal of quickly
                    returning to college became more complex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where everything started to truly went downhill.
                    On top of problems I wouldn't want to talk about, the
                    realization hit me that transitioning into
                    adulthood at 18, all while being confined to my house for
                    months and eventually a year, would be one
                    of the most horrifying
                    experiences to ever happen to me. Each passing day felt
                    like a year of my youth slipping away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The routine of being confined and the uncertainty about
                    the future took a toll on my mental well-being.
                    It felt strange and lonely, like I was missing out on what
                    should have been an exciting time in my
                    life. Time seemed to pass in a weird way, and the dreams
                    and plans I used to have felt far away and
                    hard to reach because of what was happening in the world.
                    I began distancing myself from friends and people around me.
                    I felt like an imposter, as if all the
                    accomplishments from my high school days were just illusions.
                    The realization started to sink in
                    that perhaps, I wasn't the 'smart kid' my friends and
                    family believed me to be. And from that point forward, what
                    followed were the darkest months of my
                    life. The weight of self-doubt and the uncertainty of the
                    future became overwhelming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In late 2021, as the world began to slowly recover from the
                    pandemic, I made the decision to return
                    to college. However, unlike the first time, which was
                    filled with hope and optimism, this time it
                    felt like stepping into a different reality.
                    The experiences of the past months had changed me.
                    The once clear and straightforward path now seemed
                    clouded with uncertainty.
                    In the first few months of coming back to the academic
                    world, I've really struggled. It was the first time I
                    attended classes in online class, and the truth is that
                    learning in this manner was incredibly challenging for me.
                    The absence of face-to-face interaction and the shift to a
                    digital environment made it harder for me
                    to grasp concepts. The struggle was real, and adapting to
                    this new mode of education added an extra
                    layer of difficulty to my already complex journey back to
                    college.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I remember spending my whole days trying to grasp
                    fundamental programming concepts like arrays,
                    pointers, and recursions. Despite my persistent efforts,
                    I still grappled with confusion and
                    difficulties in fully understanding them.
                    In this challenging journey, I found myself alone, with no
                    one to turn to but myself.
                    There were moments of breakdowns, especially when
                    I couldn't complete
                    some of the Programming 1&2 exercises.
                    At those times, doubt crept in, and I questioned if choosing
                    this course was a mistake.
                    Perhaps, I thought, I wasn't good enough.

                    The dreams I had as a child, ones I was truly passionate
                    about— science, language, and philosophy— echoed in my mind.
                    During these struggles, the thought lingered:
                    maybe I should have pursued those dreams instead.
                    The path I had chosen seemed rocky, and I yearned for the
                    clarity and confidence I once felt when
                    envisioning a future aligned with my childhood passions.

                    Despite the hardships and the inner voices urging me to
                    shift and veer away from the world of IT, I continued.
                    I successfully completed all my courses in the first year,
                    achieving grades that while not straight 1.0s,
                    felt more than satisfactory for me.
                    However, I soon learned
                    that as a returning student, all the honors I could have as
                    a student would be ineligible. All those President's and
                    Dean's Lister lists and all those Latin Honors I once
                    envisioned are now out of reach. As someone who had been
                    showered with academic certificates and
                    recognitions throughout my entire life, the truth is that
                    it was a hard reality to accept.
                    Reflecting on this, I came to realize that I had based much
                    of my self-validation on those
                    achievements. The danger in doing so became evident when
                    they were suddenly gone, leaving me to
                    question: what happens next when the familiar validations
                    no longer define who I am?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gradually, I started to convince myself that my worth isn't
                    determined by some papers or titles. Most
                    days, I would genuinely believed in this perspective.
                    However, there were nights, much like this one,
                    where even the most optimistic voices in my head couldn't
                    drown out the echoes of doubt and
                    insecurities. Maybe because it was never the prize or
                    the title itself, but maybe I was mourning the dreams
                    of my once 18-year-old self that now lies in the
                    underground.

                    My journey as an IT student this year isn't without
                    struggles and hardships, but as we shifted to face-to-face
                    classes, I soon encountered people who made my
                    journey feel more bearable and uplifting. I also noticed a
                    positive shift in my engagement with
                    academic tasks. The encouragement and collaborative
                    spirit of the face-to-face setting played
                    a significant role in reigniting my motivation.
                    However, it's essential to acknowledge that the journey
                    isn't consistently smooth. They never are.
                    There are still days
                    when doubts resurface, casting shadows on the progress
                    I've made.

                <p>
                    Reflecting on the past, over four years ago,
                    most of the things I envisioned for myself, where I
                    thought I would be right now, have turned out to be quite
                    different from reality. Life's journey has
                    taken unexpected turns, presenting challenges and
                    opportunities that I could not have foreseen. I've stumbled
                    countless times, so many that I've lost
                    count. Yet, despite the difficulty,
                    I've pick myself back up over the years. I have to.
                    It's a responsibility I carry alone,
                    as no one else can do it for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I won't romanticize or create a motivational narrative
                    about the challenges I've faced in recent
                    years. Those were some of the darkest moments of my life,
                    and I would never suggest that anyone
                    'needs' to go through similar struggles in order to persist.
                    The truth is that sometimes, I feel like I'm still stuck
                    with the shadows of the distant past. There are
                    moments when I feel like the 18-year-old version of
                    myself, just before the pandemic reshaped our lives.
                    I catch glimpses of myself lingering around the
                    corners of my high school classrooms,
                    in the echoes of laughter of friendship circles in the
                    campus, thinking about my friends who have now
                    graduated while I am still here, left behind. The once
                    "smart kid" that was always ahead of almost everyone,
                    now finally fell behind. When I was a kid, my biggest
                    fear was that one day, I'll just be an "average" person.
                    Now, that fear is realized. I'm no longer the best, just
                    okay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, at the age of 22, there are times when I wish I could
                    go back to my 18-year-old self and offer
                    guidance about the challenges that lay ahead. I would
                    advise him never to take a break from college,
                    to stay connected with his friends, and to dive into
                    the world of programming sooner rather than later.
                    But before I could probably do that, I would break down in
                    tears as I witness my old hopeful self plan for his future.
                    I don't know if I'll have the guts to confront him the truth
                    that no, he wouldn't graduate in 2023. No, he wouldn't be
                    with his friends for their Capstone Project. No, he would
                    never be part of the Dean's or President's Lister, or
                    any Latin honors like he'd hoped for.
                    I wish I could provide him with a foolproof guide on exactly
                    what to do and what to avoid to prevent
                    these disappointments. Unfortunately, I can't. and that's a
                    reality I would have to come terms with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But if there's one thing I wouldn't advise him to change,
                    it's choosing this course. He dreamed of
                    obtaining a degree in Information Technology and
                    crafting beautiful websites. We both shared that
                    dream— it was the only one he had left now.
                    And as his
                    future self, I would do everything I can to rock that
                    graduation cap. I am well aware that the challenges ahead
                    will only intensify, and the journey won't
                    be a stroll in the park. Yet, I owe this to my 18-year-old
                    self, the one who once aspired for the
                    moon and stars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I might not be the best programmer out there, even far from
                    it, but I am determined to make the most of this journey.
                    The dreams that began in the echoes of his hope still
                    resonate in my heart, serving as a determination
                    in this rocky journey. With each line of code and every
                    hurdle overcome, I am not just coding for a
                    degree; I am coding to honor the spirit of resilience and
                    determination that my younger self
                    embraced. It's a promise to that hopeful 18-year-old,
                    a pledge to chase those dreams and make them a
                    reality, one line of code at a time.
