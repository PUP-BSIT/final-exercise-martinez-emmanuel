                <p>
                    It's all that stands between 2023 and 2024.
                    People are out and about, getting ready for the big night.
                    Families are cozying up in their homes, preparing for the
                    "New Year" celebration.
                    Kids are running around outside, laughing and shouting,
                    too excited to keep still.
                    It's like the whole world is holding its breath,
                    waiting for the magic of a new year to begin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But let's pause for a second. Have you ever stopped and
                    wonder
                    what truly passes in that blink? We, humans, hear of the
                    word 'time', all the <em>time</em>, it is so conveniently
                    "everywhere" that most people don't even bother to think
                    about it anything beyond deadlines and schedules.
                    But as the clocks tick and
                    calendars relentlessly turn their pages— what is it
                    that they <em>actually</em> measure?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was a child, it is one of the questions
                    I caught myself asking from, well, time to time.
                    Sometimes, I would ask my parents, teachers, or even
                    playmates about it. Some of their answers go from
                    simple explanations related to clocks, or about
                    the past, present, and future, to humorous answers.
                    I would simply nod to their answers, but none of it ever
                    really satisfied my curiousity. The mystery of time
                    persisted. It was like an invisible force guiding our
                    lives, yet slipping through our fingers like grains of sand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, I wasn't the first person to ask this question.
                    Thousands of years ago, many prominent figures
                    and cultures have also
                    pondered the same inquiries. Ancient Egyptians, such as
                    Ptahhotep contemplated the nature of time. He thought about
                    how our minutes fly by. He said we have to live them wisely,
                    'cause once they're gone, there's no buying them back.
                    Across the Indian civilization, they talked about time
                    not linearly, but in loops,
                    where everything starts and ends and starts again,
                    way longer than any New Year's countdown we know.
                    Meanwhile, the early Greek philosophers generally
                    believed that the universe and time itself was infinite:
                    no beginning and no end.
                    In the 5th Century BCE, philosopher Antiphon said that
                    time is not a reality, but a concept or a measure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As human knowledge and technology progressed over centuries
                    and millenia, our inquiries and understanding about time
                    also evolved. In the time of Isaac Newton,
                    which was the late 17th and early 18th century,
                    the prominent understanding was that time was an absolute
                    and unchanging entity.
                    Newtonian physics, as described in Newton's
                    <em>Principia Mathematica</em>,
                    considered time to be an independent parameter that
                    flowed uniformly, unaffected by other physical processes.
                    It served as a constant backdrop against which the laws of
                    motion and gravity operated. In short, a "universal clock"
                    exists. Time is
                    the same for everyone and everywhere in the universe.
                    This was widely accepted, because it matches our basic human
                    intuition. It aligns with out everyday view of reality.
                    It was comfortable and relatively easy to understand.
                    This classical view of time worked well for
                    describing the motion of everyday objects and
                    celestial bodies.
                </p>

                    <h3>Newton viewed time as unchanging and constant everywhere
                        in the universe.
                    </h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    However, this once solid view of time soon faced challenges
                    as scientific understanding progressed and technology
                    enabled more precise measurements. Certain phenomena,
                    such as the behavior of light,
                    began to defy the predictions of classical mechanics.
                    What do I mean by this? For example, according to
                    classical mechanics, if you're on a moving object and you
                    shine a beam of light forward,
                    its speed should add to the speed of the object.
                    This expectation was based on the classical idea
                    that space and time are absolute and unchanging.
                    In 1887, two scientists named Michelson and Morley,
                    conducted an experiment that
                    sought to detect the Earth's motion through a hypothetical
                    "ether," the medium presumed to carry light waves.
                    According to classical physics, the speed of light should
                    vary depending on the Earth's motion through this ether.
                    To the surprise of Michelson and Morley, and to the
                    confusion of the scientific community,
                    no such interference pattern was observed.
                    It seemed that the speed of light remained the same,
                    regardless of the orientation of the apparatus or the
                    Earth's motion through space.
                </p>

                    <h3>The Michelson-Morley experiment showed that the speed
                        of light is constant regardless of the motion
                        of the observer
                    </h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Why is this a problem? Classical physics, which views space
                    and time as constant and unchanging, predicts that
                    the speed of light should be influenced by the motion of
                    the observer or the source of light. However, the results
                    of this experiment exposed the limitations of
                    classical physics and
                    sparked a debate among the scientific commumnity. This
                    inconsistency about our theories about how the universe
                    works and what is observed means that we need to
                    re-examine and revolutionize the way we think
                    about space and time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It wasn't until more than a hundred years later, precisely
                    in 1905, when Albert Einstein published a series of
                    groundbreaking papers that would shake the foundation of
                    classical physics and birthed the era of modern physics,
                    that fundamentally shifted the way we view space, time, and
                    eventually the nature of reality and the universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's talk about the first paper,
                    <b>Theory of Special Relativity</b>.
                    Imagine time as a flexible thing—it doesn't tick the same
                    for everyone. If you're moving fast, time slows down a bit
                    for you compared to someone sitting still. Also, if you
                    could somehow turn mass into energy, as shown by the
                    famous equation E=mc², you'd get a lot of energy.
                    This theory changed how we think about time and told us
                    that mass and energy are like two sides of the same coin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is the craziest part though: you see, in classical
                    physics, space and time were considered separate entities.
                    However, Einstein showed us that space and time are not
                    separate, but rather interconnected on what is called
                    <b>spacetime</b>,
                    forming a four-dimensional framework of the reality.
                    According to this theory, an event in the universe is
                    described not just by its spatial coordinates
                    (three dimensions: length, width, and height)
                    but also by its temporal coordinate (time).
                    The theory of special relativity highlighted a new,
                    groundbreaking truth: time and space are not absolute
                    but are intertwined, and we
                    we need to give up the idea that there is a "universal"
                    time,
                    and accept that the time registered by a clock depends
                    on its trajectory as it moves through the universe.

                    <h3>Special Relativity tells us that there is no such thing
                        as "universal" clock. The passage of time can change
                        relative to the observer's motion. The <em>faster</em>
                        you move through space, the <em>slower</em>
                        you move through time.

                <p>
                    In 1915, building on special relativity,
                    Einstein extended his ideas
                    on the most ambitious
                    theory he ever published, and perhaps one of the most
                    important theories in physics: the
                    <b>General Theory of Relativity.</b> In this theory, he
                    challenged our understanding of one of the fundamental
                    forces of the universe: gravity. Einstein showed that
                    gravity is not exactly a force, but a curvature of
                    spacetime itself. Massive objects, like planets and stars,
                    create a curvature in the space around them, and other
                    objects move along the curves in this distorted spacetime.
                </p>
                <div class="journal-image" id="spacetime">
                    <img src="https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2015/howeinsteins.jpg">
                    <h3>Einstein showed that gravity is a result of the bending
                        of spacetime. Note: space <em>and</em> time.
                    </h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Consider, for a moment, we put a clock ticking away
                    in the vastness of space. Now, imagine
                    placing this clock near a massive object, like a planet.
                    According to Einstein's theory, the
                    gravitational pull of the planet causes the spacetime fabric
                    to curve, literally affecting the ticking of our
                    clock and slowing it down.

                    As a result, time itself becomes entangled with gravity.
                    The closer you are to a massive object, the
                    more spacetime is curved, and the slower time flows.
                    This phenomenon, known
                    as <b>gravitational time dilation</b>, means
                    that time passes at different rates depending on how close
                    you are to a massive body.

                    To illustrate this, picture two astronauts—one closer to a
                    massive planet and the other farther
                    away. The astronaut near the planet experiences time at a
                    slower rate compared to their counterpart
                    in the more distant reaches of space.

                    If you're still reading up to this point, you may say,
                    "Well, this is all cool sci-fi theory. But I find it hard to
                    believe that time can actually move slower or faster" and
                    trust me, I totally understand. I've been there too.
                    Einstein's theories are extremely profound and ahead of its
                    time that when he first published these
                    theories, he was initially greeted with skepticism and
                    caution.
                    Einstein's propositions were not easily digestible.
                    They challenged deeply ingrained concepts, such as the
                    absolute nature of space and time, and presented a new
                    framework that required a significant shift in our thinking.
                    The idea that time could be relative, and that the
                    geometry of spacetime could be influenced by mass and
                    energy, contradicted centuries-old principles and human
                    intuition.

                    It wasn't until many years later, when the "golden era" of
                    General Relativity came through. As our technologies
                    became more advanced and so does our experiments, the
                    scientific community soon embraced Einstein's theories and
                    became a pinnacle of modern physics.

                    Einstein's revelation about gravity's impact on time
                    wasn't just a theoretical curiosity. It had practical
                    consequences, influencing our everyday technologies like
                    GPS systems. Satellites in orbit experience slightly
                    weaker gravity than on Earth's surface, causing time to
                    tick just a bit faster for them. Without correcting for
                    this effect, our GPS devices
                    wouldn't be as accurate as they are.

                    <h3>Modern GPS uses the mathematics of General Relativity
                        to maintain its accuracy. Since it is located thousands 
                        of kilometers away from a massive object (Earth), 
                        it experiences 
                        time slowly, and thus must be synchronized with the 
                        clocks 
                        on the ground. Otherwise, its tracking
                         would be off by kilometers.

                    You may think that with Einstein's ideas, we've finally
                    solved time. However, the truth is, while Einstein's 
                    theories of relativity have been very successful in 
                    explaining how time and space behave in many situations, 
                    similar to how Newton's classical mechanics worked, 
                    they do have limitations— especially when it comes to 
                    the most extreme places and events in the universe. 
                    
                    One of the predictions of General Relativity is the
                    existence of black holes. Black holes are regions in 
                    spacetime that are so dense that its gravitational pull 
                    becomes overwhelmingly strong that not even light, the 
                    fastest object in the universe, can escape from it. 
                    
                    Einstein's equations work incredibly well in many 
                    situations, but as we delve into the intense gravitational 
                    forces near a black hole, things get tricky. 
                    The equations reach a zone where they can't quite give us 
                    a clear picture of what's happening. 
                    It's like trying to use a map that suddenly goes blank 
                    in the middle of an unknown territory.

                    When scientists try to investigate what happens at the 
                    heart of a black hole, Einstein's mathematical 
                    equations break down, and they encounter something
                    perplexing: infinities.
