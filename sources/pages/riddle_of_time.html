                    It's all that stands between 2023 and 2024.
                    People are out and about, getting ready for the big night.
                    Families are cozying up in their homes, preparing for the
                    "New Year" celebration.
                    Kids are running around outside, laughing and shouting,
                    too excited to keep still.
                    It's like the whole world is holding its breath,
                    waiting for the magic of a new year to begin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But let's pause for a second. Have you ever stopped and
                    wonder
                    what truly passes in that blink? We, humans, hear of the
                    word 'time', all the <em>time</em>, it is so conveniently
                    "everywhere" that most people don't even bother to think
                    about it anything beyond deadlines and schedules.
                    But as the clocks tick and
                    calendars relentlessly turn their pagesâ€” what is it
                    that they <em>actually</em> measure?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was a child, it is one of the questions
                    I caught myself asking from, well, time to time.
                    Sometimes, I would ask my parents, teachers, or even
                    playmates about it. Some of their answers go from
                    simple explanations related to clocks, or about
                    the past, present, and future, to humorous answers.
                    I would simply nod to their answers, but none of it ever
                    really satisfied my curiousity. The mystery of time
                    persisted. It was like an invisible force guiding our
                    lives, yet slipping through our fingers like grains of sand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, I wasn't the first person to ask this question.
                    Thousands of years ago, many prominent figures
                    and cultures have also
                    pondered the same inquiries. Ancient Egyptians, such as
                    Ptahhotep contemplated the nature of time. He thought about
                    how our minutes fly by. He said we have to live them wisely,
                    'cause once they're gone, there's no buying them back.
                    Across the Indian civilization, they talked about time
                    not linearly, but in loops,
                    where everything starts and ends and starts again,
                    way longer than any New Year's countdown we know.
                    Meanwhile, the early Greek philosophers generally
                    believed that the universe and time itself was infinite:
                    no beginning and no end.
                    In the 5th Century BCE, philosopher Antiphon said that
                    time is not a reality, but a concept or a measure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As human knowledge and technology progressed over centuries
                    and millenia, our inquiries and understanding about time
                    also evolved. In the time of Isaac Newton,
                    which was the late 17th and early 18th century,
                    the prominent understanding was that time was an absolute
                    and unchanging entity.
                    Newtonian physics, as described in Newton's
                    <em>Principia Mathematica</em>,
                    considered time to be an independent parameter that
                    flowed uniformly, unaffected by other physical processes.
                    It served as a constant backdrop against which the laws of
                    motion and gravity operated. In short, a "universal clock"
                    exists. Time is
                    the same for everyone and everywhere in the universe.
                    This was widely accepted, because it matches our basic human
                    intuition. It aligns with out everyday view of reality.
                    It was comfortable and relatively easy to understand. 
                    This classical view of time worked well for
                    describing the motion of everyday objects and
                    celestial bodies.

                    <h3>Newton viewed time as unchanging and constant everywhere
                        in the universe.

                    However, this once solid view of time soon faced challenges 
                    as scientific understanding progressed and technology 
                    enabled more precise measurements.
